# Jumper
### A simple geometric game where you bounce and climb your way up to the best score!

This is a small project I took on a few years ago while attending a Python course in highschool, just for fun. I made a port later to Java using [Processing](https://www.processing.org "Processing.org") for learning purposes. In the Java version, I also added a few functionnalities such as score display, best score save and a pause screen. Note that it also has better performance than the initial Python version.

The game is as follows: you control a blue disc that bounces up and down and your goal is to climb up as much randomly generated platforms as you can by moving it with the left and right keyboard arrows. Press space to initiate the first jump and thus start the game.

##### Have fun!
